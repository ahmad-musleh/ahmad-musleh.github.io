                The nature of what computer science is about barely involves physical activity. And telling a computer to do things that are
                tedious for humans doesn't imply that I should remain idle and inactive. <br>
                Powerlifting is a nice way to test one's strength, measure progress via progressive overload and to let off some steam sometimes.
                I am currently experimenting with a mix of hypertrophy and strength training (close to powerbuilding)<br>
                Side effects include impeccable presentation skills. ;)<br>

                People often dread the daily commute to/from work. But if you have the right car it can be a very enjoyable ride. It doesn't have to be a hypercar, any turbocharged 2jz
                powered car would do. I don't think of a car as an object that takes me from point A to B but as a vessel surfing through the lanes enjoying the exhaust note coupled with
                the turbo flutter. I'd rather go on a longer route than stop at a traffic light. I'd park farther away in a parking lot so that it isn't 'accidentally' dinged. My favourites
                include the Supra, Evo and C63 AMG.

                I've had a goal to make reading a new habit. Starting off with novels, then transitioning to

                and technical. Here's my Goodreads to-read shelf. Better get started :D.
